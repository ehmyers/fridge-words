expressive environment
=======================

This was built with HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and a database.  It is meant to be an expressive environment that the user will interact with it, and want to continue it.  This environment is built to look (at first) just like the fridge magnets you can buy to use in a physical form.  

However, once the user begins arranging the magnets, all the nouns will behave in Oulipo's "n + 7" constraint, meaning that each noun will be replaced by the seventh noun down from it in the database I've created.  

In addition, the words can be, by user interaction, shuffled around on the page.  The background will change after a random number of seconds, to show a different fridge texture.  This is a work still in progress, check back later for a more complete version.

Update: picking this back up as of July 2016 - more progress to come soon, hopefully.
